# Musical STFT Tensor Decomposition Project

This is a final project for the Math 605D course at UBC.

The two main files of interest are the [Report](https://github.com/njericha/TensorDecompSTFT/blob/c1296c7881286c4fa9e885f12bd0d7b946f53b56/Report.pdf) which details the full project with background information, main results, and references, and the Julia [Slideshow](https://github.com/njericha/TensorDecompSTFT/blob/05118a13ef46ab98fe40054d77078c379e2b4403/slideshow.ipynb) which walks through the main experiments and findings in a more interactive format.
