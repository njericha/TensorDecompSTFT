# Musical STFT Tensor Decomposition Project

This is a final project for the Math 605D course at UBC.

Most of this repository is for me to practice using Julia's package manager, VS Code and Git. The main file of interest is the [Slideshow](https://github.com/njericha/TensorDecompSTFT/blob/05118a13ef46ab98fe40054d77078c379e2b4403/slideshow.ipynb) which walks through the main experiments and findings.
